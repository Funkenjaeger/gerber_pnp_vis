## Manual pick-n-place visualization tool
### Overview
The purpose of this tool is to facilitate the process of manual SMD parts placement on a PCB.  The goal is to allow the user to populate a board with a minimal amount of clicking, **no** manual cross-referencing, and without reliance on the presence or legibility of silkscreen markings.

The tool renders a realistic representation of the bare PCB and a filtered parts list showing only the SMD parts which go on the currently visible side of the board.  When any part is selected in the list, the location of all instances of that part are highlighted directly on the board.

The tool directly consumes files generated by the CAM processor of Eagle EDA tool (now Fusion 360 Electronics), similar or identical to the files which would be sent to a PCB fab house.  Gerber files are used to render a realistic representation of the bare PCB.  Bill of materials (BOM) and pick-n-place files are used to determine what parts are on either side of the board, and their locations.
